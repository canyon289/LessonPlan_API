# Get Apple Stock Ticker

## Instructions

* In this activity, you will retrieve the stock ticker for Apple from Quandl
* Consult the [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/tools/python) documentation
 for the method used to accomplish this task.

## Hint
* The [Quandl Stock Documentation](https://blog.quandl.com/api-for-stock-data)
may also be useful
* Think back to the Python APIs week. What were the APIs returning there?
What is being returned here?

## Bonus

* If you finish the activity early, try tweaking the parameters. For example
can you grab the stock ticker for another company? Can you grab the GDP of 
United States?

* Try getting the stocks for multiple companies at one time. Remember 
the DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) principle when implementing this
