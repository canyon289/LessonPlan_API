# Get Apple Stock Ticker

## Instructions

* In this activity, you will retrieve the stock ticker for Apple from Quandl
* Consult the [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/tools/python) documentation for the method used to accomplish this task.
  * The [Quandl Stock Documentation] (https://blog.quandl.com/api-for-stock-data)
  may also be useful

## Bonus

* If you finish the activity early, try tweaking the parameters. For example
can you grab the stock data for another company? Can you grab the GDP of 
United States?

For example, can you fetch ten tweets with the script? If you haven't yet sent out more than ten tweets from your account, do that first.
